# Development

Use Zig 0.16.0 or later.

## Workspace tooling on `main`

`main` carries only shared tooling. Validate it with:

```bash
zig build
zig build test --summary all
zig build current-runtime-consumer-test --summary all
zig build otlp-collector-fixture-test --summary all
zig build package-check --summary all
zig build package-history-check --summary all
zig fmt --check codegen/ eng/ build.zig
```

`main` owns no package source, so root tests run workspace tooling and fixture
consumers that pin `azure_sdk_core` by immutable commit and hash. The original
`direct_package_consumer` retains Core 0.1.2 compatibility coverage.
`current_runtime_consumer` pins Core 0.4.1 and separately exercises canonical
runtime and pipeline construction, owned request headers, explicit OTLP JSON
export and W3C propagation, and the published HTTP and SDK crypto conformance
modules. Its standard HTTP and allocation-failure contracts use local fixtures,
not Azure credentials. The catalog and history checks still cover all registered
package identities.

The [App Configuration OTLP fixture](../eng/fixtures/otlp_collector_interop/README.md)
uses the immutable released service client and Core mock transport. Its default
tests and runnable JSON generator are offline. A separate, explicitly invoked
Linux script can verify that unmodified reference JSON against a pinned official
local OpenTelemetry Collector; ordinary builds/tests never start that process
or require the optional Collector executable. See the fixture README for setup,
loopback-only safety controls, verification and deferred production-export scope.

## Branch-owned package work

Fetch the package branch and create a feature branch from it:

```bash
git fetch origin sdk/storage_blobs
git switch --create feature/storage-retry FETCH_HEAD
zig build test --summary all
```

Open the pull request with `sdk/storage_blobs` as its base. Do not merge
branch-owned package source into `main`.

Validate the published branch from a `main` checkout with:

```bash
scripts/package-branch-release.sh verify azure_sdk_storage_blobs
```

Package manifests must pin internal dependencies by immutable URL and hash.
Workspace-local `.path` dependencies are not used for released packages; the
root fixture consumers and codegen pin `azure_sdk_core` by immutable URL and
hash.

## Reset history tooling

The reviewed mappings remain available for provenance:

```bash
scripts/package-history-reset.sh analyze
```

The completed cutover is recorded in
[`package-reset-2026-07-24.md`](package-reset-2026-07-24.md). Candidate
reconstruction requires the sealed pre-cleanup Main commit recorded there;
current `main` intentionally contains no branch-owned source.

## Generated package work

TypeSpec-generated packages can target an external package worktree:

```bash
codegen/scripts/sync.sh \
  --output-root /path/to/keyvault-package \
  --azure-sdk-core-commit <commit> \
  --azure-sdk-core-hash <hash> \
  keyvault_secrets
```

Container Registry determinism can compare independent package worktrees:

```bash
scripts/verify-container-registry-regeneration.sh \
  --rest-package-root /path/to/rest-container-registry \
  --sdk-package-root /path/to/sdk-container-registry
```

## Before opening a pull request

Run the smallest relevant package test first, then the ownership-appropriate
checks above. CI enforces formatting and the three fixed package-branch check
contexts.
