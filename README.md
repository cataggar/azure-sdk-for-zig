# Azure DevOps REST for Zig

`azure_rest_devops` is the generated Azure DevOps protocol package for
the **7.2** REST contract. It is entirely generator-owned; update the
TypeSpec source or emitter and regenerate instead of editing package
files by hand.

## Protocol surface

Azure DevOps publishes its REST API as 44 independent areas that share
a host family, an auth scheme and a release cadence, so they ship here
as one package with a Zig namespace per area rather than 44 packages.
Each area exposes a root client (`root.git.GitClient`) whose accessor
methods reach the area's operation groups
(`git_client.repositories()`), matching the shape Azure DevOps uses in
its REST documentation.

`api-version` is client state pinned to the area's 7.2 contract, and
each area's root client carries the default endpoint for its own host
(`dev.azure.com`, `vssps.dev.azure.com`, `pkgs.dev.azure.com`, …),
overridable through `InitOptions` for Azure DevOps Server.

The source contract is the `typespec` branch of
[`cataggar/vsts-rest-api-specs`](https://github.com/cataggar/vsts-rest-api-specs/tree/typespec/typespec),
which converts Microsoft's published Swagger 2.0 definitions to
TypeSpec. The `.azure-sdk-generator` provenance file records the
generator revision, the spec revision and the reproducible generation
command.

## Build and regeneration

```bash
zig build test --summary all
```

The manifest pins `azure_sdk_core` by immutable release commit and Zig
package hash.
